        <p>A home equity line of credit is a loan on the equity of your house. Your home’s equity is the value of your home minus the amount of money you currently owe on your mortgage. The better your home’s equity, the more money you are generally able to borrow. </p>
        <p>Unlike traditional lump-sum loans, HELOCs are a line of credit. This means you can borrow up to your maximum loan amount and make payments throughout the loan repayment period. You can then continue borrowing from the same line of credit after you replenish it - much like a credit card.</p>

        <p><strong>Usage Flexibility</strong> - HELOC loans are popular with some borrowers because they can be used for many purposes without strict rules over where the funds go. Some examples of reasons people take out HELOCs include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Home Repair</li>
            <li>Vacations</li>
            <li>Tuition and Educational Expenses</li>
            <li>Debt Consolidation</li>
            <li>Medical Expenses</li>
            <li>Weddings</li>
            <li>Emergency Expenses</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Borrow What You Need</strong> - Unlike lump-sum loans, lines of credit mean you’re in control of how much you borrow and spend. Some people find it easy to spend more than anticipated when cash is deposited directly into their bank account, such as with a cash-out refinance option. A line of credit means loan holders can borrow only what they need, when they need it.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Less Risk</strong> - While they both use the value of your home to secure a loan balance, mortgages can be riskier to borrowers than a HELOC. In the event you cannot repay your loan, mortgages take top priority, and receive any available funds immediately. HELOCs, on the other hand, are only required to be repaid after any mortgages are paid off.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Secured Status</strong> - Another advantage HELOC has over other loans is its secured status. Secured loans are borrowed against collateral. In this case, the loan is “secured” against the collateral of your home’s equity. Because secured loans involve less risk on the lender’s side, loan terms tend to be more favorable, and loans can be easier to secure than other traditional loan types. This includes lower interest rates, lower initial costs, and tax-deductible borrowing in some cases. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>Unique Benefits</strong> - For a borrower who has paid off a large percentage of their mortgage and owns the majority of their home, HELOCs can be particularly beneficial. Similarly, if the value of your home has increased significantly since you purchased it, a home equity loan could give you very favorable loan terms. Finally, tax-deductible borrowing can make great financial sense for borrowers planning to use their HELOC to make home repairs.

        <p>The first step in securing excellent HELOC loan terms is using the right financial institution. Excel Federal Credit Union works hard to ensure our members get the best possible rates when they finance through us. We also waive closing costs for borrowers who meet specific criteria. After that, loan terms will be determined by a variety of factors. If you’re concerned with making sure you get great rates on your HELOC loan, take a look at the following items and make sure you’ve optimized your chances to get the terms you want.</p>
        <p><strong>Credit Score</strong> - A good credit score can help you qualify for promotional rates and earn you a better annual percentage rate when signing. While there is no set minimum credit score to qualify for a HELOC, most lenders prefer to see a score of at least 620. If you’re eager to get the best possible deal, take some time to review your credit history and optimize your credit score to make sure you’re setting yourself up for success</p>
        <p><strong>Home Equity</strong> - Home equity is obviously necessary to be approved for a HELOC. Generally, lenders like to see at least 15-20% equity on a home before approving a HELOC application. You’ll want to ensure you have excellent home equity to get the best possible rates and the highest credit limit.</p>
        <p><strong>Income</strong> - Income isn’t necessarily a make-or-break factor regarding HELOC approval since the loan is secured. However, showing you make a significant salary on your proof of income can help you qualify for great terms.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Debt To Income Ratio</strong> - Again, there is no set-in-stone rule for the necessary debt-to-income ratio you’ll need to be approved. However, lenders generally like to see ratios less than 50%. The better your debt-to-income ratio is, the more likely you are to get the interest rate and terms you want.

        <p>HELOC interest rates are variable and calculated using third-party financial data known as the index rate, such as the prime rate. This can benefit or negatively impact borrowers depending on economic fluctuations and the corresponding index rate. EFCU calculates variable interest rates on HELOC loans using the prime rate published by The Wall Street Journal each month.</p>
