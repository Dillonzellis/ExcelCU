    <h2 class="fs-475 clr-neutral-100 fs-400 fw-medium">Why Get a Personal Loan?</h2>
    <div class="content-section | fs-400 clr-neutral-900 fw-regular | pb-400">
        <p>So why take out a personal loan? There are many reasons individuals may explore this option that depend on
            personal and financial factors. Loans can differ depending on credit history, credit score, payment history,
            and other personal financial factors.</p>
        <p>Some popular reasons people take out credit union personal loans include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Moving / Home Costs:</strong> If you’re gearing up for a home remodel or a big move, a personal
                loan can help ease extra costs during this transition.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Vehicles:</strong> Personal loans can be instrumental in covering costs for vehicles like cars,
                boats, and RVs.</li>
            <li><strong>Emergencies:</strong> Emergencies strike at random, and sometimes you do not have the funds to
                cover a repair or accident. Some people use personal loans to fix cars, home appliances, or medical
                emergencies.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Large Purchases: </strong>If you are gearing up to make a large purchase, like a new heating
                system or washer, personal loans can help cover the upfront cost</li>
        </ul>

    <h2 class="fs-475 clr-neutral-100 fs-400 fw-medium">How Can I Use a Personal Loan?</h2>
    <div class="content-section | fs-400 clr-neutral-900 fw-regular | pb-400">
        <p>Personal loans can be used however the loaner wants them to be, depending on your financial situation. There
            are
            some restrictions on personal loans to make them a viable option for loaners that wish to pay off debt or
            achieve other personal financial goals. Loans can also vary depending on credit score or lines of credit
            that
            have been opened.</p>
        <p>Some of the common ways loaners use their funds include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Weddings</li>
            <li>Vacations</li>
            <li>Vehicle Costs</li>
